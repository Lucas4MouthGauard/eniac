# ENIAC LLM Loader 🚀

A retro-futuristic web experience that humorously imagines loading a modern Large Language Model onto the 1946 ENIAC computer. This project combines historical computer nostalgia with cutting-edge AI concepts, creating a unique meme-worthy experience.

## 🎯 Concept

**Core Meme**: 1946's ENIAC relied on vacuum tube warm-up, and in 2025 we're giving it a "hot start" with an LLM - forcibly binding vintage hardware with cutting-edge AI to create temporal dislocation absurdity.

## ✨ Features

### 🎬 Loading Sequence Animation
- **Tube Warm-Up**: Vacuum tube heating simulation
- **Tokenization**: Token processing visualization  
- **Parameter Shuffle**: Weight distribution animation
- **Attention Routing**: Neural network routing display

### 🖥️ Interactive Terminal
- Authentic retro terminal interface
- Easter egg commands (X, CA, help, warmup, status)
- Command history and processing simulation
- Copy-to-clipboard functionality

### 🎨 Visual Elements
- CRT scan lines and noise overlay
- Glowing vacuum tubes with hover effects
- Animated paper tape scroll
- Retro-futuristic color scheme (black, phosphor green, amber)

### 📱 Responsive Design
- Mobile-optimized layout
- Smooth animations with Framer Motion
- Modern web standards with retro aesthetics

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
